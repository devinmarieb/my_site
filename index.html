        We can start at the very beginning. I had very typical high school jobs. I worked in both a movie theater and a AAA baseball stadium, Hadlock Field, home of the Portland Seadogs, formally owned by the Marlins, now owned by the Red Sox (if you're into that kind of thing). The switch from teal to navy blue did not go over well with some people in the beginning, and to this day, teal merchandise is coveted.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I also held two very relatable jobs in college - a retail worker at a clothing store and an assistant manager at a candy store. I got my first cavity after that year, but I also learned I love black licorice and marzipan.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After college, the majority of my young adult life was spent going through the ranks at an Apple retail store. I was a Specialist, a term used for the majority of people you interact with at the stores, a Lead Cashier, a Visual Merchandising Lead (yes I got to touch all the new products days in advance), and finally a Scheduling Administrator for employee schedules. Aside from having good times and making great friends, I also learned I never want to work in customer service at that level ever again. I don't know if you've ever seen an iPhone launch in a major city, or what it looks like when one half of a couple realizes that when you share an iCloud account all your photos are accessible to each other, but neither situation is pretty.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After my quarter-life crisis and a career change to development, I moved from elevation to below sea level to do creative frontend work with WeTransfer. The majority of my work revolves around a variety of interactive and animated
        <a class="work-link"href="https://wetransfer.com/advertise/gallery" target="blank"><i>client advertising</i></a> projects.
        Beyond that, I've built mini sites like
        <a class="work-link" href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/story/wetransfer-craig-taylor-anything-but-guns/#/" target="blank"><i>Craig Taylor: Anything but guns</i></a> and
        <a class="work-link" href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/story/ideas-report-2018/#/" target="blank"><i>Ideas Report 2018</i></a>.
        I also manage and maintain <a class="work-link" href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/" target="blank"><i>Ideas by WeTransfer</i></a>, a creative blog, and have created custom articles for our content blog,
        <a class="work-link" href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/" target="blank"><i>WePresent</i></a>.
        For a little while, I also made custom
        <a class="work-link" href="https://reallygoodemails.com/search/emails/wetransfer" target="_blank"><i>email templates</i></a>
         for our marketing and brand emails.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I really like SVGs.

        Is the design of this site purposfully kind of messy? Yes. I use this site as a creative outlet, so it changes occassionally. Right now I'm feeling kind of messy. Anyway, I'm an only child who is also a Taurus, which is another way of saying I'm incredibly independent and stubborn.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Yes, I'm into true crime, I have been since childhood. I can remember my gymnastics team stopping practice on two occasions to crowd around a TV, once to watch the finale of Seinfeld and once to watch OJ's car chase. Beyond that, I used to love reading. My favorite author is Ray Bradbury, my favorite book being <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. I don't read as much as I used to and I fully blame streaming culture for this shift in personality. I do a lot of listening to podcasts though. Beyond true crime (and there are <i>a lot</i>), some of my favorites are National Geographic's "Overheard", BBC's "World Questions" and The Times' "1619." This might shock a lot of people, but if you asked me if I wanted to listen to music or a podcast, I'd respond with "podcast" in almost all circumstances. Though, just so you can judge my personal tastes, my favorite song of all time is
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgmRb3MlpHQ" target="_blank">Fleetwood Mac's 1976 live performance</a>
        of "Rhiannon." I also really enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejSvXJxPcFg" target="_blank">Odesza</a>, which if you live in Colorado, sHocKiNg I know.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some rapid fire random facts: German Shepherds are my favorite dogs and one day I plan to own one, though I also want to rescue a greyhound. I like small towns more than large cities. I enjoy hiking. My favorite style of beer is a New England IPA. I'm really good at trivia and I watch Jeopardy as often as possible. I've been to twenty countries on four continents. My favorite YouTuber is
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu5bR_89W7U" target="_blank">Jenny Nicholson</a>.
        I used to be able to speak Spanish well -- I need to relearn. My very first concert was Ben Folds. My favorite actor is Tim Curry. Below are some of my favorite things to exist on the internet:<br/>

      `Vacationland. This is where I grew up. Born and raised in Portland, Maine, surrounded by
      rocky coasts, fishing boats and seagulls. I attended
      <a class="about-link-maine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deering_High_School" target="_blank">Deering High School</a>,
      where I fostered the dream to one day become a writer. Children’s books, copywriting, novels, it didn't
      matter much then. This is what I was going to pursue in college.`,
      `From one idyllic New England town to another. For four years I lived in Burlington, Vermont, where I attended
      <a class="about-link-vermont" href="https://www.champlain.edu/" target="_blank">Champlain College</a>.
      I took a variety of writing classes, and developed a bigger interest in copywriting, which is what I intended to do after
      graduation. I also had an interest in writing young adult novels and kept a few side projects. I had the opportunity to travel
      to Europe a few times and caught the travel bug. My junior year I decided to study abroad.`,
      `As soon as winter hit my junior year of college, I got on a plane to Brisbane, Australia to attend
      <a class="about-link-australia" href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/about-griffith/campuses-facilities/nathan" target="_blank">Griffith University</a>
      for a semester. I took the opportunity to learn about the country and travel around. I was lucky to have an abundance of
      time to hit all the spots like Sydney, Melbourne, the Outback, the Great Barrier Reef, and even New Zealand and Fiji.
      This really sparked something inside me, and I knew I never wanted to stop traveling.`,
      `After graduation, the recession had hit, and my dream of being hired at an ad agency as a copywriter was gone. I took a job working at
      <a class="about-link-boston" href="https://www.apple.com/retail/cambridgeside/" target="_blank">Apple</a>
      and stayed there for quite some time, moving through various roles the company had. I ate my way through the delicoius restaurants of Boston, and
      made life long friends. Eventually, having spent almost the entirety of my twenties in Boston, I knew it was time to move on. I quit my job and headed west.`,
      `I was obsessed with the west as a kid. Deserts, cacti, mountains with big skies. I was excited to start what I thought was going to be the last big move of my life. I drove my belongings from the east coast to Colorado. I hiked, explored the local beer scene, ate countless breakfast burritos, and went through a quarter-life crisis. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. After a brief stint as a legal assistant, I decided to drop everything and attend the
      <a class="about-link-denver" href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software & Design</a>
      to learn frontend development. I had every intention of staying in Denver, but another opportunity came my way I couldn't pass up.`,
      `I moved to Amsterdam in 2017 to become a frontend developer in the creative studio at
      <a class="about-link-amsterdam" href="https://www.wetransfer.com" target="blank">WeTransfer</a>.
      I work with digital designers on a variety of projects, and I've learned a lot about design principles and tools in the process.
      Aside from work, I've gotten to travel more than ever. I've found greater independence traveling around solo, and I've had the opportunity to grow by meeting so many interesting people from all over the world. When I'm not roaming around the city (which right now is always), I often think about the book I want to write, or the mountains I can't see.`
